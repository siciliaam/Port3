Here is a multi-agent GridWorld game using the Q-learning algorithm. There are 2 agents who will receive additional points when passing through grids containing coins, and will lose points when passing through grids with cannons. The main objective of this game is for the agents to reach the main reward, which is a treasure. Both agents will move automatically to collect the highest score with the fewest steps, and the game will finish when one of the players reaches the main reward.
